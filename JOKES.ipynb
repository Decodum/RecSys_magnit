    "Финальное задание.\n",
    "1.  Использовать можно весь набор данных Jester DataSet, но сохранив разбивку на выборку для обучения и для теста (id участников и шуток сохранены в github (https://github.com/NameArtem/recommendation_in_practice_tutorial/tree/main/code/BaseLine))\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Разрешено использовать новые варианты алгоритмов, но желательно не уходить далеко в «сложные нейронные сети» и не использовать архитектуры, которые вы не понимаете (случайные архитектуры нейронных сетей из интернета).\n",
    "Лучшим вариантом является гибридная рекомендательная система с разными эвристиками до или после скоринга + ранжировщик результатов. Это покажет изучение темы и самого набора данных (помните про ответственную разработку своих решений).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Результатом вашей рекомендательной системы должна быть последовательность (список в списках) из двух результатов: [[топ рекомендация], [ранжированная последовательность из 10 рекомендаций]].\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Позиция 1 будет проверена по метрике RMSE, ранжированная последовательность будет оценена по MAP@10 \n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Основная задача сохранить метрику, которую вы получили на Kaggle лидерборде, но упор делаем на метрики: diversity, serendipity, novelty, coverage.\n",
    "Помните, что необходимо реализовать баланс, где хороший топ будет интересен и в наборе.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  Результат работы желательно встроить в контейнер, чтобы его можно было бы запустить автопроверкой.\n",
    "Контейнер должен получать данные, трансформировать их в готовый pandas DataFrame для работы, скорить переданных клиентов и возвращать результат в связке: клиент и результат из п.3 (см.выше).\n",
    "Контейнер уже реализован, ваша модель должна быть его основным механизмом. Пример реализации: https://github.com/TripleAVerAlpha/docker\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  Если не удаётся запустить контейнер или его создать, то на вопросы ответит Золотых Александр.\n",
    "Учитывайте, что контейнер, может быть не реализован (т.к. понимание, что сложно и важнее реализовать модель), но сама модель должна запускаться.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  Результат прошу загрузить на GitHub, а ссылку передать через форму https://forms.gle/Ay2b9z7nuhtgPBkFA"
